Simple 2D game
Made with C++

Uses: SDL2, cmake, python3, gtest, Qt (editor)

Modules:
Base - type aliases, debug macros, and custom string/container types for use in all the other modules
ECS - Base class for components and systems, logic and helper-classes for entities/components manipulation
GameData - ECS components and data for them, some isolated classes like FSM, Vector2D, ...
Utils - alghorithm implementations: graph search, collision detection, save-load
HAL - interface layer between the game and human interfaces (input, display, sound, ...)
GameLogic - ECS systems, game initialization and the game loop
UnitTests - unit tests
AutoTests - game examples that run for limited period of frames with fixed dt and RNG seeds

To build the game you need:
- git-lfs
- CMake
- python3
- a compiler that supports C++17
- for linux you need to install SLD2, SDL2_Image SDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf (devel and static)

To build the editor you need:
- git-lfs
- CMake
- python3
- a compiler that supports C++17
- Qt Creator
